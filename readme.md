# Windows 7 Installation Guide

This guide covers installation of Windows 7 OEM on a device with an OEM license including downgrade rights to Windows 7 Professional. This guide is Dell-based but should equally apply to systems from major OEMs such as Lenovo and HP. This guide was originally on WordPress however I rewrote it on GitHub because I surprisingly got a lot of requests for this guide when I discontinued my WordPress subscription.

## End of Life

Windows 7 Reached End of Life 5 years ago in April 2020 and should be deemed insecure. **Use with caution.**

## Firmware Technologies

Power up your Device and press `F2` (Dell Devices) to enter the BIOS/UEFI Setup. The function key combination may differ for other manufacturers. Check with your device manufacturer for the correct function key combination to enter the BIOS/UEFI setup:

<img src='./images/img_001.png' alt='img_001' width='600'/>

At the top is the system model, date of manufacture and BIOS Version:

<img src='./images/img_002.png' alt='img_002' width='600'/>

The BIOS Version should match the final version available for your model.

Additional details such as the Processor, installed memory, video controller and wireless card should display:

<img src='./images/img_003.png' alt='img_003' width='600'/>

The menu to the left hand side displays an option that says UEFI and an option that says Secure Boot. These options need to be configured for a Windows 7 installation.

Windows 7 was released in September 2009 when the motherboard firmware used the Basic Input Output System (BIOS) which is now known as a Legacy BIOS. Unified Extensive Firmware Interface (UEFI) was an improvement to BIOS and was developed in 2011 shipping with some business models before it became the standard in 2012.

Intel only provided Windows 7 drivers for motherboards that use 1st-6th generation processors. In the case of the OptiPlex 7050, the motherboards socket supports 6th generation processors and 7th generation processors. As the motherboard is supported for Windows 7 and the 7th generation processor uses the same motherboard drivers, this configuration will work. This may not be the case for motherboards which only support 7th generation processors.

For reference:

|Model|Release Date|Processor|SLIC|Technologies|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|~~OptiPlex 755~~|2008|Intel Core 2 Duo|~~2.0~~|Legacy BIOS|
|OptiPlex 760|2009|Pentium|2.1|Legacy BIOS|
|OptiPlex 780|2010|Core 2 Quad|2.1|Legacy BIOS|
|OptiPlex 390/790|2011|2nd Generation (Sandy Bridge)|2.1|UEFI BIOS â€“ No Secure Boot, there is no option for Legacy ROMs as these are always Enabled|
|OptiPlex 3010/7010|2012|3rd Generation (Ivy Bridge)|2.1|UEFI BIOS with Secure Boot (only with the latest UEFI BIOS Update)|
|OptiPlex 7020|2014|4th Generation (Haswell)|2.1|UEFI BIOS with Secure Boot|
|OptiPlex 7040|2015|6th Generation (Skylake)|2.1|UEFI BIOS with Secure Boot|
|OptiPlex 7050|2017|6th Generation (Skylake) or 7th Generation (Kabylake)|2.1|UEFI BIOS with Secure Boot|
|~~OptiPlex 7060~~|2018|~~8th generation (Coffeelake)~~|2.1|UEFI BIOS with Secure Boot|

## OEM Product Activation (OEM CoA, OEM SLP and OEM SLIC)

Windows 7 had a number of product activation mechanisms. 

The key on the Code of Authenticity (CoA) was typically only used for Retail Product Activation. On devices shipped with Windows 7. The CoAs provided to OEMS were often of low print and prone to fading so were later placed in the battery compartments of laptops or hatches to reduce exposure:

<img src='./images/img_004.png' alt='img_004' width='600'/>

The product key on the CoA was typically never used for OEM Product Activation and use of this product key with retail installation media required phone activation. 

Instead of a unique product key, offline device firmware based product activation was used. OEM Installation media automatically inputs a generic OEM System Locked Preinstallation (SLP) key and Windows 7 automatically activates offline with the SLP key. This automatic product activation only takes place when the motherboard has a compatible System License Internal Code (SLIC) embedded in the devices firmware:

|Firmware|OS|Downgrade Rights|
|---|---|---|
|SLIC 1|Windows XP||
|SLIC 2.0|Windows Vista|Windows XP Professional|
|SLIC 2.1|Windows 7|Windows Vista Business + Windows XP Professional|
|MSDM + SLIC 2.1|Windows 8 Professional|Windows 7 Professional|
|MSDM + SLIC 2.1|Windows 8.1 Professional|Windows 7 Professional|
|MSDM + SLIC 2.1|Windows 10 Professional|Windows 7 Professional|

Devices shipped approximately half a year before the release of Windows 7 were eligible for a free upgrade and had a BIOS update which updated the SLIC from 2.0 to 2.1.

OEM SLP is the only activation mechanism available for devices that use OEM Downgrade rights from Windows 8 Professional or Windows 10 Professional to Windows 7 Professional.

## Download Windows 7

The [Windows ISO Download Tool](https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-and-office-iso-download-tool) can be used to list Windows ISO Downloads.

<img src='./images/img_005.png' alt='img_005' width='600'/>

Windows 7 reached end of life in January 2020 and Microsoft have removed most Windows 7 related downloads... 

<img src='./images/img_006.png' alt='img_006' width='600'/>

<img src='./images/img_007.png' alt='img_007' width='600'/>

However OEMs like Dell retain their legacy downloads. Although the ISO listed appear to be model specific, they are generic and do not have a model specific driver pack slipstreamed. Select OptiPlex 7040 and select Windows 7 Professional 64 Bit or Windows 7 Professional 32 Bit:

<img src='./images/img_008.png' alt='img_008' width='600'/>

Then select Download:

<img src='./images/img_009.png' alt='img_009' width='600'/>

Although this ISO says Windows 7 Professional, it is a multi-edition and multi-lingual ISO containing:

* Windows 7 Starter* (2011)
* Windows 7 Home Basic (2011)
* Windows 7 Home Premium (2011)
* Windows 7 Professional (2016**)
* Windows 7 Ultimate (2011)

\* 32 Bit only.

\*\* The Windows 7 Professional index of the install.wim was slipstreamed to include USB 3.0 drivers and NVMe drivers giving support for 6th Generation Intel (Skylake) Processors. Internet Explorer 11 was slipstreamed alongside a large number of security updates. 

Minor changes can be made using a text editor to switch edition, OEM or channel once the Bootable USB has been created.

## Creating a Bootable USB with Rufus

The last version of Rufus to support Windows 7 is version 3.22. Rufus can be downloaded from the official website [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/downloads/). Launch Rufus:

<img src='./images/img_010.png' alt='img_010' width='600'/>

Select select:

<img src='./images/img_011.png' alt='img_011' width='400'/>

Select the Windows 7 ISO and select Open:

<img src='./images/img_012.png' alt='img_012' width='400'/>

Select check ISO checksums:

<img src='./images/img_013.png' alt='img_013' width='400'/>

The SHA256:

<img src='./images/img_014.png' alt='img_014' width='400'/>

Should match the SHA256 listed on the Windows ISO Download Tool, if it does not the ISO is corrupt:

<img src='./images/img_015.png' alt='img_015' width='600'/>

If the computer supports UEFI and Windows 7 64 Bit is being used, the Partition Scheme should be GPT and the target system UEFI:

<img src='./images/img_016.png' alt='img_016' width='400'/>

If the computer has a Legacy BIOS or Windows 7 32 Bit is being used, the Partition Scheme should be MBR and the target system BIOS:

<img src='./images/img_017.png' alt='img_017' width='400'/>

Select Start:

<img src='./images/img_018.png' alt='img_018' width='400'/>

Select OK:

<img src='./images/img_019.png' alt='img_019' width='400'/>

When finished, Rufus will say Ready, select Close:

<img src='./images/img_020.png' alt='img_020' width='400'/>

## Selecting Windows 7 Edition or OEM

The default edition is Windows 7 Professional and Dell OEM SLP is applied by default. Skip this step if these defaults match your system.
